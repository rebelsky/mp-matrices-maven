# Matrices (two-dimensional arrays)

A sample solution to the matrices project for CSC-207.

Overview:

The project provides a `Matrix<T>` interface and an implementation of that interface called `MatrixV0<T>`. In addition to initialization and setting and getting of elements, the `Matrix` interface provides mechanisms for adding and removing columns and rows and for setting portions of the matrix to a particular value.

The class `MatrixExperiments` (in the package `edu.grinnell.csc207.experiments`) contains some experiments with matrices.

The classes `SampleGame1p` and `SampleGame2p` (in the package `edu.grinnell.csc207.main`) contain simple one- and two-player games, respectively.
